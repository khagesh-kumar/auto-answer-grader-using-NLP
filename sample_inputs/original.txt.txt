Global warming is the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the temperature near the earthâ€™s surface. This phenomenon has been observed over the past one or two centuries. This change has disturbed the climatic pattern of the earth. However, the concept of global warming is quite controversial but the scientists have provided relevant data in support of the fact that the temperature of the earth is rising constantly. There are several causes of global warming, which have a negative effect on humans, plants and animals. These causes may be natural or might be the outcome of human activities. In order to curb the issues, it is very important to understand the negative impacts of global warming. It can be reduced by setting a high price of carbon, increasing the biofuels production from organic waste, use of renewable energy like solar and wind power, safeguarding forests and improving energy efficiency and vehicle fuel economy.
